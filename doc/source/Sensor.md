In this part, we mainly provide fundamental sensors, including Ultrasonic sensor, DHT11, DS18B20(new).

Sensor plays a essential role in Mixly, we pack some fundamental sensor such as Ultrasonic to a library so that students can use them directly. They just need to choose Trig pin and Echo pin. It can reduce programming difficulty and avoid wasting time. It can make students concentrate on realizing creative ideas.

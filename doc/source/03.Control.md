In this part, Mixly provides blocks that you can control the executive structure.

### Setup
The contents in Setup block can only be executed once. Therefore, we often put the variables' declaration or definition of function into set up block.

### DELAY

You can use the delay block to delay sometime. The unit is millisecond(ms).
### IF and SWITCH
In mixly, there are two conditional statement, one is IF-ELSE, another is SWITCH.
IF-ELSE: first, we will judge whether satisfy the condition in IF sentence. If TRUE, do a series of instructions. If false, do another aeries of instructions.

Click the blue button, you can add ELSE sentence.

### LOOP
Mixly provides three kinds of loop structure:FOR, WHILE, DO WHILE, which is the same as language C.
The function of loop structure is to execute some code repeatedly. 

FOR:using a count variable i from a to b, when the loop finish once, i=i+step. when i>b, break the loop.

WHILE:If satisfy the condition, do repeatedly until the condition returns false, then will break the loop.

DO-WHILE:First, do the sentence, and then judge whether satisfy the condition. If TRUE, do repeatedly, otherwise, break.

### SYSTEM RUNNING TIME
You can use this block to read the system running time from the program running.

In this part, Mixly provides blocks that you can control the executive structure.

### Setup
The contents in Setup block can only be executed once. Therefore, we often put the variables' declaration or definition of function into set up block.

### LOOP
Mixly provides three kinds of loop structure:FOR, WHILE, DO WHILE, which is the same as language C.
The function of loop structure is to execute some code repeatedly. 

FOR:using a count variable i from a to b, when the loop finish once, i=i+step. when i>b, break the loop.

WHILE:If satisfy the condition, do repeatedly until the condition returns false, then will break the loop.
